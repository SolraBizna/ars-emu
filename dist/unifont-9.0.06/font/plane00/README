The Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane consists of 2^16 = 65,536 code points.
Of this number, 2,048 are the Surrogate Pairs, from U+D800..U+DFFF.  This
leaves 65,536 - 2,048 = 63,488 code points.

==> The total number of lines in the files below should be 63,488 <==

   hangul-syllables.hex
   nonprinting.hex
   omit.hex
   pua.hex
   spaces.hex
   unassigned.hex
   unifont-base.hex
   wqy.hex

The number of lines can be conveniently determined in this directory with

   wc -l *.hex

The last line will be a grand total, and this should equal 63,488.  Here
is the output of "wc -l *.hex" with the Unifont 9.0 glyph files:

  11172 hangul-syllables.hex
     95 nonprinting.hex
      2 omit.hex
   6400 pua.hex
     17 spaces.hex
   1818 unassigned.hex
  16161 unifont-base.hex
  27823 wqy.hex
  63488 total

If there are any duplicates, most likely these will be from new glyphs
being added to unifont-base.hex that were not removed from unassigned.hex.
A simple comparison using unidup will show this:

   sort *.hex | unidup

If there are duplicate code points, unidup will print them.

Note that nonprinting.hex, pua.hex, and unassigned.hex might
not be included in the final generated unifont.hex file.  If desired,
they can all be added by modifying the make file one level above this
directory (modify the UNIFILES definition in ../Makefile) or with
the call to "make" in the top-level directory with a command such as:

     make UNASSIGNED="plane00/unassigned.hex" PUA="plane00/pua.hex"
