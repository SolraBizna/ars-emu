# How to build unifont.ttf from GNU Unifont's unifont.hex
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Written by Luis Alejandro Gonzalez Miranda - http://www.lgm.cl/
#

#
# 2008 - Paul Hardy created this Makefile from Luis' original
# howto-build.sh and other bash scripts.  Those original scripts
# don't appear in this archive, but they can be retrieved from
# http://www.lgm.cl/.
#

# First of all, you need a Perl interpreter and FontForge.
#
# I don't remember all the steps, but I think it was as described by
# this script.

# This division is done only so the Simplify and RemoveOverlap
# operations don't use up too much memory, and because
# a .sfd generated from the whole unifont.hex would be too big to
# process all at once.

all: outline

#
# Commented out this operation on SFD file because not all applications
# correctly interpreted the settings:
#
#	    SetFontNames("UnifontMedium", "GNU", "Unifont", "Medium", $(COPYRIGHT), "$(VERSION)"); \
#
# Convert unifont.hex to unifont.sfd as a single file, then generate
# an outline TrueType font.
#
outline: $(FONTFILE).hex $(BINDIR)/hex2sfd
	echo "Converting font as a single file."

	$(FONTFORGE) -lang=ff -c \
	   'Open($$1); \
	    SetFontNames("$(PSNAME)Medium", \
		"$(FONTNAME)", "$(FONTNAME)", "Medium", \
		$(COPYRIGHT), "$(VERSION)"); \
	    SelectAll(); \
	    RemoveOverlap(); \
	    Simplify(64,1); \
	    Save($$1);' \

	echo "Converting .sfd font into .ttf font"

#
# This fontforge script reads a BDF font file and generates an SBIT font file.
# Author: written by Qianqian Fang, given to Paul Hardy in 2008.
# The SBIT font is far smaller than the default outline TrueType font
# and takes far less time to build than the outline font.  However, it
# isn't scalable.  An SBIT font could be created and merged with the
# larger TTF font using fontforge, but I (Paul Hardy) haven't noticed
# any degradation in the screen rendering of just the outline TTF font
# that this Makefile produces as its final product.  This is with
# daily use of this Makefile's default TrueType font.
#
# This builds an SBIT font from the unifont_sample BDF font.  The
# BDF font already contains font name, etc., so they don't need to
# be set using SetFontNames; those parameters are left null so the
# existing font's values will be preserved.  However, Fontforge
# does not read the FONT_VERSION property so Paul Hardy added the
# the SetFontNames call.
#
# Commented out because not all applications correctly interpreted
# the settings:
#
#	    SetFontNames("","","","","","$(VERSION)"); \
