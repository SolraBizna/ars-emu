.SH NAME
unihexfill \- Generate range of Unifont 4- or 6-digit hexadecimal glyphs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.br
.B unihexfill
<
.I unassigned-ranges.txt
>
.I filler-glyphs.hex
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B unihexfill
is a shell script that reads a list of code point ranges from STDIN
and produces filler glyphs of 4- or 6-digit code points on STDOUT.
.P
The format of the input file is a combination of comment lines,
single code points on a line, and start/stop pairs of code points on
a line separated by a space.  Comment lines start with a semicolon (';')
by convention.  Start and stop code points are strings of hexadecimal
digits, by convention either four or six digits.
.P
.B unihexfill
invokes
.B unihexgen
for each non-comment line in its input file.  If a codepoint is less than
or equal to "FFFF" (i.e., 0xFFFF), a four-digit hexadecimal number is encoded
within the corresponding Unifont glyph as two digits on each of
two rows.  Otherwise, a six-digit hexadecimal number is encoded as
three digits on each of two rows.
.SH OPTIONS
There are no options.
.SH FILES
*.txt as input; *.hex as output.
.SH EXAMPLE
In the Unifont source package, the file font/plane01/Makefile generates
Unicode Plane 1 hexadecimal filler glyphs of unassigned code points within
assigned scripts with this single-line command:
