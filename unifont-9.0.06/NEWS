2016-12-22: Release 9.0.06

   Refined about 50 Pikto CSUR glyphs.

   Corrected two Osage glyphs and one mathematical operator as noted
   in ChangeLog.

2016-12-10: Release 9.0.05

   Modified Cherokee glyphs to reflect changes in recent Cherokee font
   that the Unicode Consortium adopted for its code charts.  Removed
   serifs to make Cherokee glyphs easier to read.

   Modified Pikto CSUR glyphs after comparison with high-resolution scans
   of Basic Pikto book.

2016-10-29: Release 9.0.04

   Extended "{" and "}" by one pixel so they now come to a point in the center.
   Swapped U+2A05 and U+2A06 so they are now in the correct order.

2016-10-21: Release 9.0.03

   Added CSUR glyphs:
     - Aiha: added doubling combining glyph, omitted from the ConScript
       Unicode Registry (CSUR) code chart.
     - Tonal System: base 16 counting system devised by John William Nystrom
       in the mid-19th century.
     - Pikto: added the Pikto glyphs to Plane 15 Private Use Area, in the
       range specified in the CSUR.

   The giant picture of all of Plane 0 now includes the Plane 0 CSUR glyphs,
   although those are an optional part of Unifont in separate font files.

2016-08-27: Release 9.0.02

   Added 3 more CSUR scripts.  Modifications to some existing glyphs.

2016-07-02: Release 9.0.01

   Updates to support Unicode 9.0.0.

2015-06-28: Release 8.0.01

  Updates to support Unicode 8.0.0.

2014-10-23: Release 7.0.06

   A few new scripts were added:
      U+010350..U+01037F Old Permic
      U+01F650..U+01F67F Ornamental Dingbats
      U+01F780..U+01F7FF Geometrical Shapes Extended
      U+01F800..U+01F8FF Supplemental Arrows-C

   Various changes were made to Makefiles, Perl scripts, and one bash
   shell script to conform to Debian Policy Manual version 3.9.6.

   Several changes were made to Makefiles:
      * Use "set -e" at the start of multi-command shell invocations,
        to trap errors.
      * Use "&&" rather than ";" in multi-command shell invocations,
        to fail on errors.
      * install now uses "-s" flag for C program binaries.

   Other minor changes were made to scripts; see ChangeLog
   for details.

2014-10-17: Release 7.0.05

   Modified ASCII letter 'l' so it would have the same height as
   the other lower-case letters with ascenders; this is one pixel
   taller than the capital letters.  Lowered the horizontal stroke 
   in 't' by one pixel so it would line up with the horizontal
   stroke in 'f'; this is one pixel lower than the x-height of
   the ASCII letters.  Letters elsewhere in Plane 0 that were formed
   with 'k', 'l', or 't' were checked and modified where appropriate
   to conform with the new ASCII glyphs.

   Completed the Miscellaneous Symbols and Pictographs script in Plane 1,
   and modified Plane 1 Emoticons and Transport and Map Symbols scripts.

   Now create file font/compiled/plane01.html, showing a color-coded
   indication of completion of all of Unicode Plane 1 as an HTML
   table in a self-contained HTML file.  That and the compiled/index.html
   are the two HTML files that building the font creates.  The plane01.html
   file gives a color coding to show completion of each 256-glyph block,
   from 0% (pure red) to 100% (pure green).

2014-10-11: Release 7.0.04

   Added five more Supplemental Multilingual Plane (Plane 1) scripts
   and improved others thanks to several contributors.  There are now
   over 5,000 drawn assigned glyphs for Plane 1!

   Reorganized font/plane01 directory.  Several other changes; see
   ChangeLog file for details.

   unihex2sfd and unipagecount now handle all Unicode planes, not just
   Plane 0.


2014-07-01: Release 7.0.03

   Minor release for Debian.  Added a man page for unihexfill(1);
   Debian requires a man page for each program.

2014-06-22: Release 7.0.02

   Fixes a bug in font/Makefile: there were two "done" statements at the
   end of one "for" loop.  Also adds many new Supplemental Multilingual
   Plane (Plane 1) scripts.  See the ChangeLog file for details.

2014-06-21: Release 7.0.01

   Provides a glyph for every visible code point in the Unicode 7.0 Basic
   Mulitlingual Plane.  Also adds more scripts in the Unicode 7.0
   Supplemental Multilingual Plane.  See the ChangeLog file for full
   details.

   Note that the versioning scheme has changed.  Instead of a date, this
   package will use an incrementing minor version number in the future
   ("01", "02", etc.).

2014-02-14: Release 6.3.20140214

   This version adds the GNU Free Documentation License 1.3 to the "COPYING"
   file.

2014-02-04: Release 6.3.20140204

   This version added Qianqian Fang's name to the COPYRIGHT string now
   passed to Fontforge when the TTF fonts are built, for his contributions
   contained in the file "font/plane00/wqy.hex".

   This version also removes "<img>" links to icons on external websites from
   the "hangul/hangul-generation.html" web page, which were retrieved and
   stored locally when the original web page was saved in the "hangul/"
   directory.

2014-02-02: Release 6.3.20140202

   This version is the first designed to easily build multiple fonts.
   To accomplish this, font/Makefile and font/ttfsrc/Makefile were
   modified to pass FONT and COMBINING parameters, giving the names
   of the font file and its associated combining.txt file.

   This version introduces a subset of Unicode's Supplemental Multilingual
   Plane (SMP, or Plane 1).  The file "font/plane01/plane01.hex" contains
   a glyph for every visible code point in the Unicode 5.0 SMP except
   "Cuneiform" and "Cuneiform Numbers and Punctuation"; those two scripts
   require more resolution than what will fit within a 16 by 16 pixel grid.
   Andrew Miller drew well over 1,000 glyphs for this effort, and added
   glyphs for several SMP scripts introduced after Unicode 5.0.

   This version also introduces a subset of the ConScript Unicode
   Registry (CSUR) Private Use Area glyphs.  Wojciech Stryjewski created
   glyphs for Tengwar and Klingon -- Tolkien fans and Trekkies rejoice!
   Paul Hardy drew Cirth to finish the Tolkien set, and drew other scripts.
   Andrew Miller made very extensive additions for the CSUR; see the
   ChangeLog for details.

   Finally, this version includes a special PSF font for using APL
   in console mode on GNU/Linux.  This PSF font contains 512 glyphs
   as a subset of Unifont; it will not work on systems that only
   support PSF fonts with 256 glyphs.  This PSF font will support
   GNU APL and several other APL implementations.

   The names of the font files are as follows:

      unifont-*               Font with Unifont Plane 0 glyphs

      unifont_sample-*        Font with Unifont glyphs, with combining
                              circles added for illustration

      unifont_csur-*          Font with glyphs from Unifont plus the
                              CSUR PUA glyphs

      unifont_upper-*         Font with glyphs from Planes 1 through 14

      unifont_upper_csur-*    Font with glyphs from Planes 1 through 15

      Unifont-APL8x16.psf.gz  The APL console font

Glyphs for code points U+FFFE and U+FFFF, previously added for illustration
purposes in unifont_sample, were removed because they caused problems on
Microsoft Windows XP.  These glyphs are still included in the large bitmap
graphic of Unifont but are no longer in the font itself.

Many other small changes were made as noted in the ChangeLog file, but
support for glyphs beyond Unicode's Basic Multilingual Plane is the most
notable change.

2013-12-21: Release 6.3.2013121

   The default font name that hex2bdf creates has changed from
   lower-case "unifont" to "Unifont".

   FontForge's SetFontNames function calls were removed because
   not all applications correctly interpreted their settings.
   For example, LibreOffice only listed Unifont by the foundry
   name ("GNU") rather than foundry + font name ("GNU Unifont")
   or just the font name.  Those calls are only commented out
   so they could easily be re-introduced.

   Some glyphs were changed for better appearance with APL.

2013-12-17: Release 6.3.20131217

   This fixes three bugs:

        * doc/Makefile: removed redirection of texi2pdf output.
        * font/Makefile: don't modify PCF fonts with FontForge,
          which alters them so grub-mkfont can't read them.
        * font/ttfsrc/Makefile: remove *.bdf so unifont_sample.bdf
          gets deleted.

   Also includes a few formatting changes; see ChangeLog.

2013-12-15: Release 6.3.20131215

   This version introduces unihex2png and unipng2hex, two Perl scripts
   that Andrew Miller wrote based upon Paul Hardy's unihex2bmp.c and
   unibmp2hex.c programs.  These new scripts allow conversion between
   the Unifont .hex format and Portable Network Graphics (PNG) files
   for graphical editing.  With this addition, more graphics programs
   can be used to edit Unifont glyphs.

   unihex2png and unipng2hex also support glyphs that are 24 or 32
   pixels tall, in addition to Unifont's default 16 pixels tall.
   Roman Czyborra's hexdraw and hex2bdf Perl scripts were modified
   to also support glyphs that are 16, 24, or 32 pixels tall.  These
   changes have not been fully tested, and at this point are considered
   experimental.

   There are no plans to add this multi-height support to unihex2bmp.c
   and  unibmp2hex.c.

   The package now contains a "doc/" directory, with documentation
   in Texinfo format.  Files in the "man/" directory were updated
   for consistency, especially in noting that all programs are
   covered under GPLv2+ now.

   In addition to "unifont-*.*" font files, this package now also creates
   "unifont_sample-*.*" files.  These "Unifont Sample" fonts contain
   combining circles, and four-digit hexadecimal glyphs for unassigned
   code points and Private Use Area glyphs.  Because of the inclusion
   of combining cirlces, "Unifont Sample" font versions are only intended
   for illustrating individual glyphs, not for general-purpose writing.
   The two generated fonts are unifont_sample-*.bdf and unifont_sample-*.ttf.
   The TTF file contains SBIT glyphs, not outlined TrueType glyphs like
   "unifont-*.ttf".

   The font versions (BDF, PCF, and TTF) now contain copyright and
   version information.  This will help identify outdated versions
   of a font in the future.  hex2bdf now accepts a version string and
   a copyright string as command line arguments.

   To simplify this package supporting two versions of Unifont
   ("Unifont" and "Unifont Sample"), hex2bdf now accepts a font name
   as a command line argument.  This will streamline adding additional
   fonts in the future as part of this same package.  Note that the
   old XLFD font name "unifont" has now been capitalized to "Unifont".

   Many XLFD properties have been added to the BDF version of Unifont
   in addition to font version and copyright XLFD properties.  At least
   some of these are carried over to the PCF version during conversion
   with bdftopcf.  This has solved an issue with grub-mkfont and FreeType
   for converting the PCF font into a GRUB version.

   Some glyphs were redrawn: the Capricorn sign, several CJK Radicals
   Supplement ideographs, and several Armenian letters.  The Armenian
   letters were modified with the new unihex2png and unipng2hex programs.

   Further details are in the ChangeLog file.

2013-10-20: Release 6.3.20131020

   This is the first release as part of the GNU Project.
